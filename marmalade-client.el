;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple API client for Emacs and marmalade-repo,
;; based on Nic Ferrier's lexical scope `web' client.

;; Mainly this is useful because it lets you upload a package to
;; marmalade-repo.  If you open a buffer with a package file in it you
;; just have to:

;;   M-x marmalade-upload [RET]

;; and enter your username and password and you're away.

;; If you're not in a package buffer then marmalade-client will ask
;; you what your package file is.  This means you can also upload
;; multi-file packages.

;; It also allows removal of packages.  Again you need to have a
;; login, you also need to be assigned an owner of a package:

;;   M-x marmalade-remove-package [RET]

;; marmalade does completion of package names based on what your Emacs
;; has downloaded from marmalade.  If a package is missing perhaps you
;; need to:

;;   M-x package-refresh-packages [RET]

;; and try again.

;; You can also add owners to your package:

;;  M-x marmalade-client-add-owner [RET]

;; This makes it easier to distribute the management of releases and
;; also to hand off a package when you get tired of maintaining it.
